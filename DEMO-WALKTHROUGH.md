# Testnet Demo Walkthrough

This guide follows a commitment from its policy and evidence through time-based health and budget eligibility. Use NEAR testnet only. The demo never asks for a private key; new commitments use the connected NEAR wallet's NEP-413 message-signing capability.

## Start the Demo

Set the public app configuration in the ignored `apps/demo/.env.local` file:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_LCP_CONTRACT_ID=livingcommitmentsprotocol.testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_NETWORK_ID=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_RPC_URL=https://test.rpc.fastnear.com
```

Run `npm run dev --workspace=@lcp/demo` and open `http://localhost:3000`. The demo follows the system color preference and lets you switch between dark and light mode from the top bar. Connect a testnet wallet when signing or submitting an action. The recent list, older-page control, wallet connection, and disconnection have been manually checked in Firefox.

## Follow Existing Testnet Examples

1. Inspect commitment `22` and refresh **Health clock**. It shows evaluation `1`, challenge `4` invalidation, and evaluation `2` recovery, followed by policy-derived evidence expiry and grace deadlines. Its latest snapshot showed the next claim blocked during the challenge window.
2. Open evaluation `2` and confirm the OutLayer public record's transaction, input, output, and WASM hashes match the contract record. This panel checks hash bindings; use the linked OutLayer report's **Verify** action or standalone verifier for the TEE quote.
3. Inspect commitment `21` and refresh **Health clock** for the short initial evidence window. Finalized samples first reported `AtRisk` at 00:21:58 AST and `Breached` at 01:21:59 AST on Nov 9. This is now a historical boundary example; see the recorded samples noted in the testnet status document.
4. Inspect commitment `8` for an upheld challenge and `9` for an invalidation followed by recovery. Inspect `19` for the completed payout, closure, and residual escrow refund.

The dashboard's health is contract-derived. The timeline distinguishes recorded commitment timestamps from deadlines derived using the immutable policy and finalized NEAR block time. It also shows accepted-evidence age, expiration, and time remaining to the next deadline; refresh it to update that snapshot. Outcomes from challenges created before completion timestamps were stored cannot be placed at an exact time and are labeled accordingly.

## Walk Through Wallet Transactions

Use a test commitment and the appropriate role wallet for each action:

1. Connect the intended creator testnet wallet and create a draft; that wallet becomes the recorded creator. Connect the maintainer wallet, click **Pin connected wallet key**, and approve the NEP-413 request. Set the sponsor, maintainer, arbiter, beneficiary, evaluator HTTPS URL and matching WASM digest, temporal policy, tranche amount, and maximum epochs. The form shows the total escrow target.
2. Fund escrow to the displayed target and fund evaluator operations with at least one execution deposit. These are separate transactions. Activate after both are funded.
3. In the evidence card, choose the evidence file (up to 25 MiB). The browser calculates its SHA-256 locally; the file is not uploaded. Confirm the displayed digest, then prepare the canonical payload. Connect the maintainer wallet, click **Sign with maintainer wallet**, approve the NEP-413 request, then request evaluation. The app checks the returned account and public-key fingerprint against policy. Refresh after the OutLayer callback to read the accepted result and updated health. The evaluator verifies the signature and digest format; it does not inspect the local file contents. If the evidence later expires, a fresh compliant evaluation can recover a Breached commitment only when its policy permits recovery; the sponsor can add operations funds while it remains active.
4. Connect the configured beneficiary wallet and claim only when the contract reports an eligible tranche. If a transfer fails and the callback restores eligibility, retry from the same action card.
5. Resolve pending evaluations, challenges, and transfers before closing. Connect an authorized party to close, then connect the sponsor wallet to request any residual escrow refund.

## Verified Browser Journeys

These flows were manually verified in Firefox on NEAR testnet:

- Commitment `24`: create, fund, activate, pin the maintainer key with NEP-413, hash a local evidence file, request evaluation, recover with fresh evidence, close, and refund residual escrow. The three funded epochs ended before a tranche became claimable, so this fixture verifies refund rather than payout.
- Isolated failed-transfer fixture commitment `2`: the first payout transfer failed, the UI showed retry eligibility, and retry completed the payment.
- Commitment `19`: a tranche was paid, then the commitment was closed and remaining escrow refunded.
- Commitments `21` and `22`: the health countdown and historical invalidation/recovery timeline were checked. Commitment `21` naturally reached `AtRisk` and `Breached` on finalized testnet time.
- The Cloudflare Pages preview: wallet connect/disconnect, NEAR reads, and OutLayer report lookup worked from Firefox.

See [TESTNET-E2E-STATUS.md](TESTNET-E2E-STATUS.md) for receipts and [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for automated checks and build reproduction. Fixture health is time-dependent; refresh snapshots before using an existing commitment. Keep all manual transactions on testnet.
